!['Harvey Nichols' print ad](http://omnio.us/play/digital-print/nichols-ad/img/HarveyNicholsLipstickStainRemover.jpg "'Harvey Nichols' print ad")

Recreating a print ad in css for the fun of it. The source is a Harvey Nichols ad I found in .net magazine for [ppa.co.uk/lovemagads](http://www.ppa.co.uk/lovemagads)

This is a digital recreation of a printed magazine ad. I saw this advertisement in one of my favorite magazines, [net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine). The overlapping hexagons were a fun challenge to recreate for the web.

This is the first of the Digital Print series. The second can be seen here: [http://omnio.us/play/digital-print/si-lebron/](http://omnio.us/play/digital-print/si-lebron/)
